Overview
========
Token open source SDKs simplify the interactions with the Token global open banking REST/gRPC API. 
The Token SDKs handle digital signatures and, where applicable, chain Token API calls. This makes 
it easier to develop Token- integrated applications, while providing most of the flexibility of 
the full Token API.
