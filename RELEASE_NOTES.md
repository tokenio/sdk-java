If you're upgrading to a new version of the SDK,
see this list for Java APIs that have changed:

## Release 2.5.0

Introduces bulk transfers. This enables a list of transfers to be approved in a single consent.
To initiate a bulk transfer request, the TPP will create a token request from the 
`bulkTransferTokenRequestBuilder` method. The bulk transfer will be submitted to the bank
when the token is redeemed. Calling `getBulkTransfer` on the bulk transfer ID will return
 transaction IDs and statuses for the corresponding transactions from the bank.

## Release 2.3.6

Added method to update Transfer Destinations, only once, for a given token request in TPP sdk.
Added builder method `setSetTransferDestinationUrl` in TransferTokenBuilder
Added `parseSetTransferDestinationsUrl` method to parse `country` and `bank` selected by the users
from the callback url set in `setSetTransferDestinationUrl` builder method.

## Release 2.3.3

Provision to set `ChargeBearer` for a `TransferToken` is made available in `TokenRequest`.

## Release 1.1.23

The `login` methods in TokenIO and TokenIOAsync were removed.

## Release 1.0.84

The `login` methods in TokenIO and TokenIOAsync were renamed to `getMember`.

## Release 1.0.79

MemberAsync.aliases() and MemberAsync.firstAlias() now return
Observables instead of values. Member and MemberAsync used to
cache their aliases; now they fetch them from the cloud as needed.

## Release 1.0.64

getBalance methods for Member and Account have been
replaced by separate methods for getAvailableBalance
and getCurrentBalance.

## Release 1.0.60

The TokenIO.notifyPaymentRequest method parameters changed.
The method now takes one parameter, the TokenPayload.
